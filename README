## What is Watchdog1337? 
Watchdog1337 is a simple network monitoring script written in bash. 
It pings the desired hosts in a fixed time interval and displays the status. 
If there are 10 or less hosts, the output fits nicely within a standard 80x24 PuTTY window.


## Install instructions:
Providing that you have downloaded and unzipped Watchdog1337 on your computer:

1.)
Add the hosts you want to monitor to the file named "hosts.lst" in the following format:
<name>:<location>:<ip>
One host per line.
Also, there must be a blank line at the end of hosts.lst, or else the last host
will be ignored due to a parsing limitation in Watchdog1337.
2.)
(Kinda optional: Set the "REFRESHRATE=" number in the file settings.cfg if you want a shorter or longer
waiting period before hosts are re-checked. Default is 5 seconds)
3.)
Give watchdog1337.sh permission to run by executing the following command:
chmod +x watchdog1337.sh

That's pretty much it! You can now start Watchdog1337 by executing the following:
./watchdog1337.sh 
 

## How does it work? 
Watchdog reads host information from the file hosts.lst and settings from settings.cfg. 
It then pings all the hosts from hosts.lst in order and returns the exit code of the ping. 
If a host does not respond, the host is highlighted in red until it responds or are removed from hosts.lst. 
After pinging all hosts, Watchdog1337 provides a short summary and waits a specified number of seconds before pinging them again. 
Watchdog1337 continues to run until interrupted by Ctrl-C or killed otherwise. 
 

## Technical details: 
Written in bash, uses ping to determine host status. 
Besides bash, the following common binaries are used: ping, uptime, tput, date, sleep, awk, tail, cut. 
Should run on most *nix flavors, 
but it has only been tested on the RedHat-based distro ClearOS (www.clearfoundation.com) 
 

## Limitations 
There are no limitation on the number of hosts, but keep in mind that hosts are pinged one at a time, 
and thus you won't know the status of the first host again before the last host is pinged (and after the set wait period) 
Each host consumes one(1) line in the console output, so keep this in mind if you want to display all hosts at the same time. 
 
Also remember that Watchdog1337 is very simple and only determines host status by ping. 
It can not tell if apache is denying connections on your webserver, unfortunately ;)
