#############################
# What is WDMap?		 	#
#############################
An experimental "plugin" for Watchdog 1337 (WD1337) which provides
a way to illustrate host statuses from WD1337 in an ascii map representation.

As WDMap is a plugin, it is not documented to the same degree as WD1337.

#############################
# Install instructions		#
#############################

Make sure you have all the requirements for running WD1337 fulfilled.


1.
Add the desired unique tags as the forth field in WD1337s hosts.lst.
E.g., Gateway:Server room:10.0.0.1:GW
In this case, GW is the unique tag for the host.
2.
The unique host tag you added, will be recognized by WDMap.
This means that when you create an ASCII map of your network, add the
unique tags to your drawing, as only these tags will change color depending on host status
E.g:
|GW|----|CORE|----|INTERNET|

3.
Start WD1337 after you check the custom cmds are activated in settings.cfg of WD1337
View the repo if they are not present in your config.

4.
Start WDMap.sh

#############################
# How does it work?			#
#############################
WDMap.sh parses information exported by WD1337.

WDMap prints out the map.txt to your terminal, and colors unique hoststags depending on status
So if the host is up, its tag is printed in green, otherwise in red.

WDMap will also warn you if the terminal size is not big enough for the drawing.
